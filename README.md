# 👋 Hi, I’m Toan Le  

💻 **Data Engineer | Software Architect | Code Enthusiast**  
🍵 Runs on coffee, code reviews, and the occasional Spark job failure (on purpose… for testing 😉).

## 🚀 About Me  
I’m a data engineer with 10+ years of experience in building things that:  
- Move data from point A to point B (sometimes with a detour through C, D, and Kafka).  
- Make sense of *petabytes* of data without accidentally summoning Skynet.  
- Turn messy lakes into beautiful, queryable, and secure data platforms.  

Currently working at **Mercedes-Benz AG** on customer data platforms.  
Before that: trivago, Shopback, startups, corporates — if it has code, I’ve probably been there.  

**Translation**: If it stores, moves, or transforms data, I can make it faster, cleaner, and less likely to wake you up at 3AM.

## 🛠️ Skills I (claim to) have mastered  
- **Languages**: `C#`, `Java`, `Scala`, `Python` (and fluent in StackOverflow copy-paste).  
- **Big Data**: Spark, Kafka, Hive, Airflow, Presto.  
- **Data Lakes**: Delta Lake, Apache Hudi, Iceberg (yes, I can sink your Titanic of raw data 🛳️).  
- **Databases**: Postgres, SQL Server, MySQL, MongoDB, Elasticsearch, Redshift.  
- **Clouds**: AWS ☁️, Azure ☁️ (soon Google Cloud, because why not?).  
- **System Design**: Microservices, ETL/ELT pipelines, messaging, CI/CD, distributed headaches.

## 🎓 Education  
- Master of Computer Science – Heilbronn University 🇩🇪  
- Bachelor of Computer Science – Ho Chi Minh University of Technology 🇻🇳  
- Thesis topics: NLP, Computer Vision, and the art of surviving research with minimum sleep.

## 😂 Fun Facts  
- I believe in **KISS**: *Keep It Simple, Stupid* — except for coffee orders.  
- Data Lakes are like real lakes: beautiful when clean, terrifying when polluted.  
- I mentor junior engineers, but mostly so I can steal their new keyboard shortcuts.  
- My commits are 50% code, 50% dad jokes in comments.

✨ Thanks for stopping by!  
If you like SQL, Spark, or sarcasm — we’ll probably get along just fine.
